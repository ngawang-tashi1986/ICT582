Sometimes we just need to put the highlights aside, since too many highlights will make our profiles look messy.

20273,"Recently switched from IPhone to Android, and the Android version of Instagram is awful compared to the iOS version. In the iOS version you have the ability to create instagram albums that don't require the pictures to all be the same size and all either landscape or portrait orientation. Android doesn't allow that feature, and the photos end up strangely cropped without the ability to make them interchangeably full screen or panoramic within the same album. I still have my iPhone, so I actually use Instagram on that instead of on my Samsung because of the issues with the album feature. Please fix this for Android!!",dislike
