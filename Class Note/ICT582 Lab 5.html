<h3> Exercises</h3>

<ol>
<li id="ex01"> 
    <p> Define a function that takes a list as a parameter,
        count and return the number of unique elements in the list.</p>
    <p>For example, if the list is <code>[1, "cat", 2, "cat", 2.3, 2 ]</code>, 
        your function should return 4 as there are only four unique elements
        in the list. 
    </p><p>Test the function by calling it three times each with a 
       different list.</p>
    <p>Hint: maintaining a temporary list inside the function, and
       adding an element into the list if it is not already in it. </p> 
    <p>Food for thought: if your list contains both 1 and True or 0 and False,
       does your program still work correctly? If not, how to correct it?
    </p>
</li>
<li id="ex02">
    <p>Revising Exercise 1 above, so that the function still takes a list
       as its parameter, but it would return both the number of unique 
       elements in the original list as well as the new list with only
       the unique elements. Test the function by calling it three times
       each with a different list. </p>
</li>
<li id="ex03">
    <p>Explain the concept of alias and cloning in Python. </p>
    <p>Read the following Python code:</p>
<pre>     a = 1
     b = a
     b = 3
</pre>
    <p>Question 1: do variables a and b  refer to the same object after the second
      statement? Explain why.  
       Verify your answer with the <code>id</code> function to see the id
       of each object.
    </p>
    <p>Question 2: in the 3rd statement, we assigned a new value to variable b. 
       Would this change affect variable a? Explain why.</p>
<pre>     x = [1, 2, 3]
     y = x
</pre>
    <p>Question 3: do variables x and y refer to the same object? Explain why. </p>
<pre>     y.append(4)
</pre>
    <p>Question 4: what is the current value of y? What is the current value 
       of x? Why? </p>
<pre>    y = y + [5]
</pre>
    <p>Question 5: what is the current value of y? What is the current value of x?
    Are x and y having the same value or different values? Why? 
</p><pre>    z = x[:]
</pre>
    <p>Question 6: what is the current value of z? Do variables x and z refer to 
       the same object or different objects? Why? Can you give some concrete evidence?</p>
</li>

<li id="ex04">
    <p> Write a program that reads a long English sentence from the 
       keyboard into a string and then break the sentence into a list
       words. Count and print out the number of words in the sentence.
    </p>
</li>

<li id="ex05">
    <p> Write a function that takes a list of words as its formal parameter 
        and capitalise each word in the list.
    </p>
    <p>  Outside the function, create 
        a list of words L and call the this function to capitalise each word 
        in the list and print out these capitalised words. 
    </p>
    <p></p>Discussion: what is the "side-effect" of a function? 
        Does your solution use or have a side-effect? Can you create one 
        version of the function with side-effects 
        and another version of the function without side-effects?
     <p></p>  
</li>

<li id="ex06"> 
    <p> Write a program that will take the marks (for three 
        assessments Quiz1 (20%), Quiz2(30%) and Final(50%)) of 
        all the students of a unit as input and stores all the 
        detail in a list. Your program should have following 
        features and constrains: </p>
    <ul>
       <li> Check the input validity: each mark must be between 0 and 100, 
            and each mark must be a whole number</li>
       <li> Compute the total mark and letter grade. The total mark is the 
            weighted average of the three marks, ie 
               total = Q1 * 0.20 + Q2 * 0.30 + Final * 0.50. 
            The total mark must be rounded to the nearest whole number.
            Use the Murdoch University grade conversion table to 
            calculate the letter grade </li>
       <li> Keep taking the input unless a negative number or zero 
            is given as the input for student ID</li>
       <li> Save the data for each student in a list in following format:
<pre>[st_ID, Q1_mark, Q2_mark, Final_mark, Total, Letter grade]
</pre>
       </li>
       <li> Display the whole list</li>
    </ul>
    <p> A typical input output screenshot might be as follows:</p>
<pre>Student ID:1001
Enter Q1: 60
Enter Q2: 65
Enter Final: 55
Student ID:1002
Enter Q1: 80
Enter Q2: 75
Enter Final: 68
Student ID:1003
Enter Q1: 45
Enter Q2: 50
Enter Final: 52
Student ID:0
[[1001, 60, 65, 55, 59, 'P'], [1002, 80, 75, 68, 73, 'D'], [1003, 45, 50, 52, 50, 'P']]
</pre>
</li>

<li id="ex07"> 
    <p> Expand Exercise 6 above. Show the following statistics: </p>
    <ul>
       <li> Average, highest and lowest mark 
            </li>
       <li> Total number of students failed in the unit (assuming 50% 
            is the pass mark) 
            </li>
       <li> Create a list containing the IDs of those students whose total mark
            is 80 or more from the list generated from Exercise 6 and print 
            the list out. Please use list comprehension to create this list.  
            </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li id="ex08"> 
    <p> Write a student management system that can perform following operations 
        repeatedly (use a continuous menu that would not exit until the user 
        wants to do so): </p>
    <ul>
       <li> Add student detail (ID, name, GPA(0~4), major, contact number etc.)</li>
       <li> Search a particular student </li>
       <li> Delete a particular student </li>
       <li> Display all dean's list students (students with GPA&gt;=3.75) </li>
       <li> Display all students detail in a user-friendly manner. Note: 
            you may use a 'list' to store all the information. </li>
    </ul>
</li>

</ol>
