<h3> Exercises</h3>

<ol>
<li id="ex01"> <p> 
       Define a function that takes two formal parameters representing two 
       numbers and returns the average of the two numbers. In the main program, 
       reads in two numbers and stores them into two variables <code>a</code> 
       and <code>b</code> respectively. The program then calls the function
       to get the average of the two numbers which are passed to the function
       as two actual parameters. Finally print out the average to the console. 
       Note: you must appropriately name the function so that it reflects 
       what the function does. As the function returns the average and is often
       called to get the average, it is better to name it using a noun. 
     </p>
</li>
<li id="ex02"> <p> 
       Revise Exercise 2 in Lab 3. This time, you should define a function
       that  reads a sequence of numbers and find the largest number in the 
       sequence.
       Then the main program call the function to read a sequence of numbers
       and print the largest number to the console.
     </p> 
     <p>As the function will find the largest number, how would you pass this
      largest number from the function to its caller? One approach is to pass 
      the largest number using a return statement. In this exercise, please 
      use this approach. Think about how to name the function.
     </p>
</li>

<li id="ex03"> <p> 
       Revise Exercise 2 above. This time, you should pass the largest number
       from the function to the caller via a global variable. Think about how 
       to name the function.
     </p>
     <p>When testing the program, deliberately provide an invalid input such as
      <code>23;4</code> and observe how the program would behave. Note you are
      not required to correct this problem in this lab.
     </p>
</li>

<li id="ex04"> <p> 
     Define a function that takes in a single character as the parameter 
     (the input character) and returns a new character using the following 
     algorithm:
     </p><ul>
       <li>If the input character is an English letter, return the next letter
          in the English alphabet, eg, 'a' =&gt; 'b', 'X' =&gt; 'Y. 
       </li>
       <li>If the input character is not an english letter, return the 
          character without change.
       </li>
     </ul>
     <p></p>
     <p>Hints: you may find the following functions <code>ord</code> and
        <code>chr</code> and string method <code>isalpha</code> useful.
     </p>
</li>

<li id="ex05"> <p> 
       Revise Exercise 1 in Lab 3. This time, the function takes a string   
       as its formal parameter and returns the number of digits inside the 
       string.  In the main program, read a string from the user and print 
       out the number of digits to the console. Repeat this process until 
       the user enters "stop". How would you name the function? 
     </p>
     <p>Hint: you may want to use string method <code>isdigit</code> 
       in this question.
     </p>
</li>

<li id="ex06"> <p> 
       Revise Exercise 5 above. This time, the function takes a string as  
       as its formal parameter and extracts the digits in the string and
       returns the number represented by the digits. For example, if the 
       string is "abc12de8fg23XYz", the function would return value 12823.
       If the string contains no digit, return 0.
       </p>
       <p>
       In the main program, read a string from the user and print 
       out the required number to the console. Repeat this process until 
       the user enters "stop". 
     </p>
</li>

<li id="ex07"> <p> 
       Revise the above exercise. This time, define a function that will take 
       a string as its formal parameter and return a new string. The new string 
       is generated by shifting the letters in the old string by one position 
       in alphabetical order, eg, "abc" =&gt; "bcd", 
        "Python is fun!" =&gt; "Qzuipo jt gvo!".
        You may use the function you defined in Exercise 4 above in this 
        question.
       </p>
       <p>
       In the main program, read a string from the user and print out the 
       shifted string to the console. Repeat this process until the user
       enters "stop".  
     </p>
</li>

<li id="ex08"> <p> 
       Revise Exercise 4 in Lab 3. This time, define a function that takes
       an integer number <code>n</code> as its formal parameter and prints 
       out a triangle with <code>n</code> rows. 
     </p>
     <p>Place the function into a Python module named <code>triangle.py</code>.
      In the main program, call the function to print triangles with
        3, 5, and 9 rows.
     </p>
</li>

<li id="ex09"> <p> 
      Revise Exercise 5 in Lab 2. This time, define a function that takes
      a number representing a temperature in Fahreinheit as its formal
      parameter and returns the temperature value in Celsius.
    </p>
    <p>Also define a function to read a daily temperature in Fahreinheit 
      from the user. As a daily temperature varies between -60 to 130 
      Fahreinheit, the function must check the input value from the user. 
      If the input value is outside this range, force the user to enter
      a new temperature value. This process will continue until a correct
      value is entered. 
    </p><p>
    </p><p>In the main program, repeatedly read a temperature value in 
       Fahreinheit and then call the function to get its equivalent 
       in Celsius and print it out to the console. This process ends 
       when the user enters "end".
    </p>
