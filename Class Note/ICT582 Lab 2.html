<h3> Exercises</h3>

<ol>
<li id="ex01"> <p>Write a simple program that reads two integer numbers 
        from the keyboard and then divides one by the other using 
        integer division and then reports the result. Note you should 
        store both inputs into variables and confirm that the second number 
        (i.e. the divisor) is not zero; this confirmation should 
        be done before actually performing the division, as division 
        by 0 is not mathematically defined and will cause your program 
        to crash. You should also store the result of the integer division 
        in a variable and print it out.
     </p>
</li>
<li id="ex02">
     <p> Add to the simple program from Exercise 1 such that after 
        performing and reporting the division result, it calculates, 
        stores and reports the remainder of the integer division of 
        the same two input integer numbers. Hint: use the modulas operator.
     </p> 
</li>
<li id="ex03">
     <p> Write a simple program that reads in an integer between 1 and 7 
        inclusive and prints out the corresponding day of the week, assuming 
        Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc. You should use a nested if--elif-else 
        statement as part of your solution. Provide a default "else" for when 
        the entered number is outside the required range.
     </p>
</li>
<li id="ex04">
     <p> Write a program using if-elif-else statements that simulates 
        the fines issued to drivers based on speeds recorded by a police 
        radar gun.
     </p>
     <p> Your program should read the recorded vehicle speed (in km/h) 
        as an integer and print the message "Speeding" if the speed exceeds 
        60 km/h or "Not Speeding" if the speed 60 km/h or less.
     </p>
     <p> The program should then calculate the appropriate fine (if applicable). 
        If the speed is 5 km/h or less over this limit, only issue a warning. 
        If the speed is more than 5 and no more than 10 km/h above the limit, 
        the fine is $100. For a speed of more than 10 but no more than 20 km/h 
        above the limit, the fine is $200. For a speed of more than 20 km/h 
        above the limit, the fine is $500.
     </p>
     <p> You should consider what to do if the input is a negative number. 
        Speed cameras do not register negative numbers, so they should not 
        be accepted as input.
     </p>
     <p> Note: data type is assumed to be int (i.e. and integer); for the 
        purpose of this exercise, DO NOT use floating point numbers.
     </p>
     <p> Also, 60 or less means the speed can be 60 but no more; this is not 
        speeding. Exceeds 60 means the speed is over 60 and therefore speeding. 
        This same logic applies when considering the other speed categories 
        and can be viewed as follows:
        </p><ul>
            <li> 61-65 inclusive = warning </li>
            <li> 66-70 inclusive = $100 </li>
            <li> 71-80 inclusive = $200 
            </li><li> 81 or more = $500 </li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
</li>
<li id="ex05"><p> Modify Exercise 5 in Lab 1 using a while loop: the program 
       will repeatedly read a user input as the temperature value in 
       Fahreinheit, and convert it to Celsius and print it out, until the 
       user input is "end". 
    </p>
</li>
<li id="ex06"><p> Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers
      between 23 and 578. Hints: which loop would you use, while or for? 
    </p>
</li>
<li id="ex07"><p> Revise Exercise 6 above, so that your program can calculate
     the sum of all even numbers between any two numbers. You should prompt
     the user to enter the two numbers. You must check the two numbers to 
     ensure they make sense for this question.
    </p>
</li>
<li id="ex08"><p>Research: in Topic 2, we mentioned operator <code>==</code>
     to compare two values to see whether they are equal. Python has another 
     operator <code>is</code> for similar purpose. Conduct a research to find
     out the similarity and difference between the two operators.
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
