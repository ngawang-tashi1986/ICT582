<h3> Exercises</h3>

<ol>
<li id="ex01"> <p> Write a program that reads a string and reverses it. 
       Your program must be able to save the new reversed string in 
       another variable. You must use "for loop" and indexing to accomplish 
       this task.  Compare your reversed string with the reversed string
       produced using the built-in syntax such as s[: : -1] to see if they 
       look the same (using comparison operator "==").
     </p>
</li>
<li id="ex02"> <p> Write a program that reads in a continuous input of 
       decimal numbers, stops when the user enters "stop". Think 
       carefully about the most appropriate loop to use for this task. 
       Upon entry into the loop body, keep track of the largest number 
       input. Once input is complete, the program should output the 
       largest number received accurate to the 3rd decimal place.
     </p> 
     <p>Hint: to keep track of the largest number during the input, you can
       use a variable, such as <code>largest</code>, to keep the running 
       largest number. Each time you get a new number from the user,
       compare it with the <code>largest</code>. If it is larger than 
       the <code>largest</code>, you update the <code>largest</code>.
       But what initial value should you give to variable 
       <code>largest</code>?  One way is to assign the first number 
       read from the user to this variable.  Alternatively, you may 
       initialise the variable to <code>float('-Infinity')</code>.
    </p>
</li>

<li id="ex03"> <p> Write a program that repeatedly reads in a line and a word
      from the user and then report whether the line contains the word.
      If the line contains the word, print out the position of the word
      in the line. The program would finish if the line entered by the user
      is "quit".
     </p> 
     <p>Use one of the string methods to complete the above task. 
     </p>
</li>

<li id="ex04"> <p> Write a program that creates the following output pattern 
       using a nested loop and a string.
</p><pre>123456789 
12345678 
1234567 
123456 
12345 
1234
123 
12 
1
</pre>
     <p></p>
    <p>
     Hint: 1) store a digit sequence in a string, such as 
          <code>char = "123456789" </code>; 2) when printing a digit inside
           a row, use <code>print(char[j], end='')</code> to avoid the newline
           at the end of each line.  
    </p>
</li>
<li id="ex05"> <p> Write a program to read a list of marks in a unit until the user
	enters "end". Calculate and report the following: 1) the total number of marks, 
	2) the number of students receiving HD, D, C, P and N grades, 3) the percentage 
	of students who fail the unit. Note, when you print the numbers and the percentage, 
	you must use formatted strings and you must print the percentage sign, such as
	"30.1% of students failed the unit".
	</p>
</li>
<li id="ex06"> <p> Modify the program in Lecture Notes to use the Guess-and-Check 
    algorithm to calculate the cubic root of a number. The modified program can 
    take any integer number as input, including negative integer number. It also 
    repeatedly asks the user to enter a number and then output its cubic root 
    if it is a perfect cube until the user enter "stop". 
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
